# Project Description

In this project, I explore Python's object model and understand the difference between various types of objects, mutability, immutability, aliasing, and more. This project provides answers to questions related to Python's object behavior.

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I was be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Understand what an object is.
- Differentiate between a class and an object or instance.
- Recognize the difference between mutable and immutable objects.
- Comprehend what references, assignments, and aliases are.
- Identify identical variables.
- Determine if two variables are linked to the same object.
- Display the variable identifier (memory address in CPython).
- Recognize mutable and immutable types.
- Identify built-in mutable and immutable types.
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions.

# Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All script files should end with a newline character.
- The first line of all script files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should comply with PEP 8 style (use pycodestyle, version 2.8.*).
- All script files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

# Tasks

1. **Who am I?**
   - What function would you use to get the type of an object?

2. **Where are you?**
   - How do you get the variable identifier (memory address) in the CPython implementation?

3. **Right count**
   - Do `a` and `b` point to the same object?

4. **Right count =**
   - Do `a` and `b` point to the same object?

5. **Right count =+**
   - Do `a` and `b` point to the same object?

6. **Is equal**
   - What does `print(s1 == s2)` output?

7. **Is the same**
   - What does `print(s1 is s2)` output?

8. **Is really equal**
   - What does `print(s1 == s2)` output?

9. **Is really the same**
   - What does `print(s1 is s2)` output?

10. **And with a list, is it equal**
    - What does `print(l1 == l2)` output?

11. **And with a list, is it the same**
    - What does `print(l1 is l2)` output?

12. **And with a list, is it really equal**
    - What does `print(l1 == l2)` output?

13. **And with a list, is it really the same**
    - What does `print(l1 is l2)` output?

14. **List append**
    - What does this script print?

15. **List add**
    - What does this script print?

16. **Integer incrementation**
    - What does this script print?

17. **List incrementation**
    - What does this script print?

18. **List assignation**
    - What does this script print?

19. **Copy a list object**
    - Write a function `copy_list(l)` that returns a copy of a list.

20. **Tuple or not?**
    - Is `a` a tuple? (Yes or No)

21. **Tuple or not?**
    - Is `a` a tuple? (Yes or No)

22. **Tuple or not?**
    - Is `a` a tuple? (Yes or No)

23. **Tuple or not?**
    - Is `a` a tuple? (Yes or No)

24. **Who I am?**
    - What does this script print?

25. **Tuple or not**
    - What does this script print?

26. **Empty is not empty**
    - What does this script print?

27. **Still the same?**
    - Will the last line of this script print 139926795932424? (Yes or No)

28. **Same or not?**
    - Will the last line of this script print 139926795932424? (Yes or No)

29. **#pythonic**
    - Write a function `magic_string()` that returns a string "BestSchool" n times the number of the iteration.

30. **Low memory cost**
    - Write a class `LockedClass` that prevents dynamically creating new instance attributes, except for the new instance attribute `first_name`.

31. **int 1/3**
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script?
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script?

32. **int 2/3**
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script?
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script?
    - After the execution of line 3, is the int object pointed by `a` deleted? (Yes or No)
    - After the execution of line 4, is the int object pointed by `b` deleted? (Yes or No)
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script?

33. **int 3/3**
    - Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), how many int objects have been created and are still in memory?

34. **Clear strings**
    - How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script?
    - How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script?
    - After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by `a` deleted? (Yes or No)
    - After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by `b` deleted? (Yes or No)
    - How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script?
