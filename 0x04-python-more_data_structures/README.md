#Project Description
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and covers Python's more advanced data structures: Sets and Dictionaries. In this project, I worked on various tasks related to sets and dictionaries, understanding how they work, and gaining practical experience in using them.

#Learning Objectives
This project aims to enable me become proficient with the following concepts:

•	Why Python programming is awesome.
•	What sets are and how to use them.
•	What the most common methods of sets are and how to use them.
•	When to use sets versus lists.
•	How to iterate over a set.
•	What dictionaries are and how to use them.
•	When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
•	What a key is in a dictionary.
•	How to iterate over a dictionary.
•	What a lambda function is.
•	What the map, reduce, and filter functions are.
#Requirements
•	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
•	All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
•	All your files should end with a new line
•	The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
•	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
•	Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 2.8.*)
•	All your files must be executable
•	The length of your files will be tested using wc
#Tasks
•	Squared Simple: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

•	Search and Replace: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

•	Unique Addition: Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

•	Present in Both: Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

•	Only Differents: Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

•	Number of Keys: Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

•	Print Sorted Dictionary: Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

•	Update Dictionary: Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

•	Simple Delete by Key: Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

•	Best Score: Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

•	Multiply by Using Map: Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

•	Roman to Integer: Create a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

•	Weighted Average: Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers in a tuple (<score>, <weight>).

•	Squared by Using Map: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map.

•	Delete by Value: Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.

•	CPython #1: PyBytesObject: Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
