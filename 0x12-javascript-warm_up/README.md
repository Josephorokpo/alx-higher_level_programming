How to affect values to variables
How to use while and for loops
How to use break and continue statements
What is a function and how do you use functions
What does a function that does not use any return statement return
Scope of variables
What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
How to manipulate dictionary

#Tasks

0. First constant, first print
 
A script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

File: 0-javascript_is_amazing.js

1. 3 languages
 
A script that prints 3 lines:

The first line: “C is fun”
The second line: “Python is cool”
The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”

File: 1-multi_languages.js

2. Arguments
 
A script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
Otherwise, print “Arguments found”

2-arguments.js

3. Value of my argument
 
A script that prints the first argument passed to it:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”

File: 3-value_argument.js

4. Create a sentence
 
A script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

File: 4-concat.js

5. An Integer
 
A script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:

If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
You must use console.log(...) to print all output
You are not allowed to use var
You are not allowed to use try/catch

File: 5-to_integer.js

6. Loop to languages
 
A script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

The first line: “C is fun”
The second line: “Python is cool”
The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”

File: 6-multi_languages_loop.js

7. I love C
 
A script that prints x times “C is fun”

Where x is the first argument of the script
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”

File: 7-multi_c.js

8. Square
 
A script that prints a square

The first argument is the size of the square
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
You must use the character X to print the square

File: 8-square.js

9. Add
 
A script that prints the addition of 2 integers

The first argument is the first integer
The second argument is the second integer
You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)

File: 9-add.js

10. Factorial
 
A script that computes and prints a factorial

The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
Factorial of NaN is 1
You must do it recursively
You must use a function

File: 10-factorial.js

11. Second biggest!
 
A script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
If no argument passed, print 0
If the number of arguments is 1, print 0

File: 11-second_biggest.js

12. Object
 
Update a given script

File: 12-object.js

13. Add file
 
A function that returns the addition of 2 integers.

The function must be visible from outside
The name of the function must be add

File: 13-add.js

14. Const or not const
 
Modigy a file  

File: 100-let_me_const.js 

15. Call me Moby
 
A function that executes x times a function.

The function must be visible from outside
Prototype: function (x, theFunction)

File: 101-call_me_moby.js

16. Add me maybe
 
A function that increments and calls a function.

The function must be visible from outside
Prototype: function (number, theFunction)

File: 102-add_me_maybe.js

17. Increment object
 
Update a script  

File: 103-object_fct.js
